This is my summary of famous article written by Ben Horwoitz [Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) . I tried to judge myself on these characteristics.



- Know Where you are playing (Strong)
	- Understand business really well
	- Understand the market, the customer, PnL, competition
	- Understand data
	- Form strong opinions and direction

- If something isn't working, its your fucking job. No excuse (Strong)

- Think time spent in program management as non billable hours. This is something you have to do if required. If you entire day was spent doing program management, you didn't do anything that day. (Low)

- Spend majority of your time figuring out what to build. (Medium - Try my best)

- Figuring out how to do it is not your Job. (Medium - stop listening to the voice of the engineer within)

- Pro-actively solve for a problem. Don't fix it daily.(Strong)

- Good product managers create leveragable collateral, FAQs, presentations, white papers (Strong)

- Voice out your concern formally. Don't lament (Very Strong)

- Try to connect your team with the outside world. Revenue and customers! (Strong)

- Good product managers think about the story they want written by the press. (Strong)

- Its ok to sound like obvious then to be not clear. Clarity is important. Bad product managers never explain the obvious (My mentor explained me this and took a lot of time to digest. This is not an easy thing to do) . (Low)

- Be Discipline. Good product managers send their status reports in on time every week, because they are disciplined. Bad product managers forget to send in their status reports on time, because they donâ€™t value discipline. (Low)


*Overall*: I need to improve on:
- Stating the obvious
- Proactively share status reports
- Spend less time on program management
- Spend more time on the next thing that should be built
