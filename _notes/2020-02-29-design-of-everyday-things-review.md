Motivation: To have a standard guiding pricinciple while thinking about user interface


### Key Frameworks

- #### Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.


Thoughts: Agree on usecases where the user interacts with the desgin for one time / infrequently. For e.g doors in a mall. Otherwise,for repeat usecase (since the user knows about the design), the design should optimize to serve other purposes. For e.g Mac touchpad is design to aesthetically look good as well as to preserve space. But for a first time user, he has no clue if double tap is supported or not
